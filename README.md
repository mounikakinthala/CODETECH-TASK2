OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:Simple calculator
OBJECTIVE:
  The objective is to create a Python program that serves as a simple calculator. It should prompt the user to input two numbers and choose an operation (addition,               subtraction, multiplication, or division). The program should perform the selected operation and display the result. Additionally, it must handle invalid inputs and 
  division by zero gracefully.
KEY ACTIVITY:
  Input Validation: Accepting and validating user inputs for numbers and the chosen operation.
  Performing Calculations: Executing the selected arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
  Result Display: Displaying the computed result or relevant error messages to the user.
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
  Python Programming Language: For creating the logic and implementing the calculator.
  Input/Output Functions: To gather user input (input()) and display results (print()).
  Arithmetic Operators: Using Python's operators (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
